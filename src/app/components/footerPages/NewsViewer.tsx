    title: "How VMS's 3-Second Payment System Is Transforming the Taxi Industry",
    category: "Product News", date: "March 2022", author: "VMS Editorial Team", featured: true,
    summary: "Every weekday morning, 15 million South Africans board a minibus taxi. Until now, that journey relied entirely on cash. VMS's AFC device changes everything — processing fares, enabling free Wi-Fi, and building financial identities for drivers, all in under 3 seconds.",
    body: `Every weekday morning, approximately 15 million South Africans board a minibus taxi to get to work, school, or home. It's the largest public transport network in the country — and until now, it has operated almost entirely on cash.\n\nCash creates problems. Drivers carry large amounts of money, making them targets for robbery. Passengers scramble for exact change. Taxi marshals collect fares in bulk and carry risk. And taxi associations have almost no visibility into what their fleet earns each day.\n\nVMS was founded to change this — and our Automated Fare Collection (AFC) device does exactly that.\n\nThe Vink AFC device installs in any 14-seater minibus taxi or bus in under two hours. Passengers tap their Vink Smart Pay Card on the device and their fare is deducted in 3 seconds — no cash, no change, no delay. The driver sees payment confirmed instantly on their screen. The taxi association receives a real-time settlement report. The passenger's card receipt is sent via SMS.\n\nBeyond fare payments, the device powers free on-board Wi-Fi for passengers and allows them to buy airtime, electricity, and pay utility bills — all from a moving taxi.\n\nFor taxi drivers, the Vink Driver Wallet links directly to the AFC device, allowing instant access to their daily earnings. Funds can be withdrawn from Nedbank ATMs or used to pay for fuel at major forecourts across South Africa.\n\nVMS charges just R0.50 per taxi transaction — the lowest processing fee in the industry. The vision is bigger than payments. VMS is building the financial infrastructure for South Africa's most important, most overlooked, and most powerful transport workforce.`,
